TASK-2
	PROBLEM STATEMENT:
The code supplied addresses an issue that pertains to predicting customer churn in a dataset connected to telecommunications. Numerous parameters, including call failure, complaints, duration of subscription, charge amount, use seconds, usage frequency, SMS frequency, unique called numbers, age group, tariff plan, customer status, age, and customer value are all included in the dataset. "Churn," which indicates whether a client has churned (1) or not (0), is the desired variable.

Interpretation/Recommendations:
•	Clustering Performance Evaluation:
•	After applying k-means clustering, I observed the use of the elbow method to determine the optimal number of clusters (k). It's essential to carefully analyze the elbow plot and identify the point where the Within-Cluster Sum of Squares (WCSS) plateaus. This point can provide insights into the appropriate number of clusters for the given data.
•	Silhouette Score Analysis:
•	The silhouette score is calculated to assess the quality of the clustering. A higher silhouette score indicates better-defined clusters. In my analysis, I found a silhouette score, and it's crucial to interpret this score. A score close to 1 suggests well-separated clusters, while a negative score may indicate issues with cluster assignments.
•	Scatter Plot Visualization:
•	The scatter plot generated using Plotly Express provides a visual representation of the data points in the reduced PCA space, colored by the target variable (Churn). It's a helpful visualization, but additional labels or annotations could enhance its interpretability.
•	Confusion Matrix Examination:
•	The confusion matrix is used to evaluate clustering performance by comparing predicted cluster labels with true labels. The classification report provides metrics such as precision, recall, and F1-score for each cluster.
•	Cluster Centers Visualization:
•	The scatter plot includes the cluster centers, marked in red. While this is useful for understanding the centroid positions.
